## User Story
Our appilcation Movie Informer is a movie search database that allows users to really look for the movies that were on the tip of their tongue. With our app you'll be able to search up a movie my its exact name or a more generalized one and get 10 results instantly. Not only will you get results with the title you searched up but also the movies poster. We wanted to make an application that really let the users pick and choose so by clicking a movies title it is then cross referenced to New York Times review database to really let users learn more about a movie and see what the critics have said. We hope that this application will help people get past those sleepless nights when youre hung on a movies title and its right on the tip of your tongue and allow you to find new movies to watch and enjoy!
